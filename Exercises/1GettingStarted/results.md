    Base Code:
        ![alt text](Result_2_Test.png)
    a. Change Test to test.\
        ![alt text](Result_2_Test_a.png)
            Output:"The public type test must be defined in its own file"
            Reason: Cannot overwrite bcs classes are derived from file names. 
    b. Change Emergency to emergency.\
        ![alt text](Result_2_Test_b.png)
            Output: "An emergency Broadcast"
            Reason: String in println function is not case sensitive.  
    c. Remove the first quotation mark in the string.\
        ![alt text](Result_2_Test_c.png)
            Output: "Lots of error"
            Reason: Println is having a stroke without "quotation marks", it works as an indicator i think..

            Output: Method error
            Reason: Testosterone Overload..

            Output:"The method bogus(String) is undefined for the type PrintStream"
            Reason: java doesn't know what bogus means and neither do I..
    f. Remove the semicolon at the end of the println statement.\
            ![alt text](Result_2_Test_f.png)
            Output:"String literal is not properly closed by a double-quote"
            Reason:Double quotation required, it works as begin and end indicator...
