This repository is a separate copy of my original forked repo:

oop-portfolio-2025-C-J0hn24 (Private)
Forked from:
OOP-2025-Classroom/oop-2025-classroom-oop-portfolio-2025-oop2025classroom-oop-portfolio-2025-OOPportfolioTemplate-1

I’ve been committing all my work to the original forked repo, but it’s set to Private by the University, and I’m unable to make it public.

That’s why I’ve created this new repository, "JAVA-OOP_Exercises", which only includes the exercise files which are required for submission.

Note: The commit timestamps might appear out of order, as they’ve been carried over. Please refer to the attached "Commit History.png" for evidence of my progress.
